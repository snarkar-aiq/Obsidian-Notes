### 1. Better Auth

- The most comprehensive authentication framework for TypeScript.
- PRoblem is it only works with TS.

### 2. [Propel Auth](https://docs.propelauth.com/)
- Works with any Frontend and Backend
- ~~Trying Multi Auth shit~~ It worked like a charm.
- So my personal preference is Propel Auth.
