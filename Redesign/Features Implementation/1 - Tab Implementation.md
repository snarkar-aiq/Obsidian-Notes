So here is the initialization and the design implementation of a simple Tab component. It uses React and Tailwind CSS to implement the required component.

So for now a simple Tab bar is being created using React and Tailwind CSS. The component renders a horizontal row of tabs, each with a text label and an active state indicator. The active state is toggled by clicking on a tab, and the corresponding tab is highlighted with a different background color. The implementation utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling, providing a clean and responsive design. The current structure focuses on the core functionality - displaying the tabs and switching between them – and doesn't include any complex features like content switching or persistent state management.

The Persistent State Management will be setup now :) To ensure the tab component retains its selected state across page refreshes and component re-renders, we’ll implement persistent state management.
