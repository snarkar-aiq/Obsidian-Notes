## Notes on Classification System

### **Inland Vessel Notation**
The system includes specific notations for inland waterways vessels:
- `Inland, [vessel type]` prefix indicates inland waterways operation
- Special combinations like "Inland, Motor Freighter Pushing Freighter(s)" indicate pushtow configurations
- Hazardous cargo types are specified (type C, type N, etc.)

### **Hazard Classification**
Both cargo and tanker vessels include hazard classifications:
- **Hazard A (Major):** Most hazardous
- **Hazard B-D:** Decreasing hazard levels
- **Hazardous category A-D:** Similar but with "category" designation

### **Multi-Role Vessels**
Many vessels serve multiple purposes, indicated by "or" combinations:
- Tug or Supply Vessel
- Ro-Ro or Passenger Ship
- Passenger or Cargo Ship

### **Industry-Specific Vessels**
The system includes specialized vessels for:
- Offshore oil & gas industry
- Fishing industry
- Dredging and construction
- Research and survey
- Naval and military operations

## Usage Considerations

1. **Traffic Management:** Used in Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) for identifying vessel types and their operational characteristics.

2. **Safety & Regulation:** Hazard classifications help in determining safety requirements and operational restrictions.

3. **Navigation Aids:** Beacon types are integrated with vessel types for navigational purposes.

4. **Emergency Response:** SAR and medical transport classifications facilitate emergency coordination.

5. **Port Operations:** Local vessel and pilot vessel classifications support port management.

This classification system provides a comprehensive framework for maritime operations, safety management, and regulatory compliance across various vessel types and operational scenarios.
