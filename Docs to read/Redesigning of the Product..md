So before handing out the product, firstly we will go through some notes made by Shivam Narkar, Junior SWE at AIQ Space Ventures who is responsible for the revamping the design.
Here is the instructions for the design revamp, focusing on improving the user experience for onboarding and initial product exploration. The primary goal is to reduce friction and guide new users through the core value proposition quickly.
### 1. [[Instructions to follow before putting hands in redesign]]

These are instructions to guide the design revamp, focusing on streamlining the onboarding process and facilitating intuitive exploration of the product for new users.

### 2. [[Starting with the new things]]

Few keep the focus on the technical aspects; instead, we need to prioritize a conversational and welcoming tone throughout the entire experience. The goal is to immediately demonstrate value and build trust, avoiding jargon and complex explanations. 

### 3. [[Which is better Routing]]

A full documentation of why prefer Tanstack router compare d to other routing libraries often highlights its performance, simplicity, and developer experience.

### 4. [[Zustand State Management with Clean Code Practices]]

Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management solution for React. It leverages hooks for a minimal API, making it exceptionally easy to integrate into existing projects. Importantly, it encourages clean code practices by emphasizing immutability and predictable state updates. We'll be utilizing Zustand's approach to build a robust and maintainable state management layer.

# **Features Implementation**

So we are starting implementation of the redesigned onboarding flow, beginning with the following : 

## [[1 - Tab Implementation]]

So, in summary , this Tab implementation is responsible for creating various instances of Map for the user.
